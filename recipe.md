Instructions
* Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F / 185ºc. Line or grease a cake pan. In a bowl whisk all the dry ingredients really well.
* Add all wet ingredients except oil to blender and blend until smooth. Add the blended puree to the dry bowl. Add oil. Mix to make a smooth batter. Transfer the batter to the cake pan and even the top with a spatula if needed.
* Bake at 365 degrees F / 185ºc for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick from the center comes out clean. It depends on the pan, oven and moisture content of the strawberries.
* Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on the wire rack for another 10 minutes or longer before slicing. Serve with whipped coconut cream and fresh strawberries or strawberry preserves.
